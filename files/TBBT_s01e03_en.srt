1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,126
Alright, just a few more feet.

2
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:14,902
And... here we are, gentlemen,

3
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:16,883
the Gates of Elzebob.

4
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:18,563
Good Lord.

5
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,861
Don't panic. This is what the
last 97 hours have been about.

6
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:24,443
Stay frosty. There's a horde
of armed goblins

7
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,651
on the other side of that gate
guarding the Sword of Asaroth.

8
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:31,005
Warriors, unsheathe your weapons.
Magic wielders, raise your wands.

9
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,346
Lock and load.

10
00:00:32,526 --> 00:00:33,971
Raj, blow the gates.

11
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:36,105
Blowing the gates.

12
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:37,934
Control,

13
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:40,505
shift... B!

14
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:45,276
Oh, my God, so many goblins!

15
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,092
Don't just stand there,
slash and move!

16
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:49,282
Stay in formation!

17
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:50,875
Leonard, you got one on your tail.

18
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:53,220
My tail's prehensile--
I'll swat him off.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,510
I got him, Leonard.

20
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,680
Tonight I spice my mead
with goblin blood.

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,163
Raj, no, it's a trap!
They're flanking us!

22
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:01,922
He's got me!

23
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:04,510
Sheldon, he's got Raj.
Use your sleep spell!

24
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:09,626
I've got the Sword of Asaroth!

25
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,422
Forget the sword, help Raj!

26
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:16,078
There is no more Sheldon.
I am the sword master!

27
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:18,903
- Leonard, look out!
- Damn it, man, we're dying here!

28
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:20,482
Good-bye, peasants!

29
00:01:21,593 --> 00:01:22,934
The bastard teleported!

30
00:01:24,957 --> 00:01:27,099
He's selling the Sword
of Asaroth on eBay.

31
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:31,105
You betrayed us for money?
Who are you?

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,658
I'm a rogue night elf.

33
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,709
Don't you people read
character descriptions?

34
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:37,769
Wait, wait!
Somebody just clicked "Buy it now."

35
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,923
I am the sword master!

36
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,792
Season 1 Episode 3:
The Fuzzy Boots Corollary

37
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:06,885
I'm all sweaty.

38
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:09,475
Anybody want to log on
to Second Life and go swimming?

39
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:11,169
I just built a virtual pool.

40
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,054
No. I can't look at you
or your avatar right now.

41
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,032
Sounds like your neighbor's home.

42
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:23,921
Excuse me.

43
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,511
Don't forget the mail you took
accidentally on purpose

44
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,006
as an excuse to talk to her.

45
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:29,600
Oh, right, right, right.

46
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:33,286
Stealing snail mail--
very old school. I like it.

47
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,872
Penny,
the mailman, did it again...

48
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:38,666
Sorry.

49
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:40,658
Hi, Leonard.
This is Doug.

50
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:42,551
Doug, this is my neighbor Leonard.

51
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:43,747
What's up, bro?

52
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:46,935
Not much...

53
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:50,222
bro.

54
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:52,514
Is everything okay?

55
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:54,905
Yeah, no, I just...
I got your mail again. Here.

56
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,595
Thank you.
I've got to talk to that mailman.

57
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,986
Oh, no, that's probably not
such a good idea.

58
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,274
Civil servants have
a documented propensity

59
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:05,665
to, you know, snap, so...

60
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,753
Okay. Well, thank you again.

61
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:09,949
No problem. Bye.

62
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:13,635
Oh, and bye... bro.

63
00:03:21,804 --> 00:03:23,398
Penny for your thoughts.

64
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:26,088
What's the matter?

65
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:27,483
I'm fine.

66
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,870
Penny's fine.
The guy she's kissing is really fine.

67
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:35,055
Kissing, what kind of kissing?
Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?

68
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:38,741
What is wrong with you?

69
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,231
I'm a romantic.

70
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:45,914
Don't tell me
that your hopeless infatuation

71
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:47,608
is devolving into pointless jealousy.

72
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:50,596
I'm not jealous.
I'm just a little concerned for her.

73
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:52,888
I didn't like the look of the guy.

74
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:54,681
Because he looks better than you?

75
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,961
He was kind of dreamy.

76
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:02,850
At least now you can
retrieve the black box

77
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,644
from the twisted,
smoldering wreckage

78
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:06,437
that was once your fantasy of dating her

79
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:08,529
and analyze the data
so that you don't crash

80
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,223
into Geek Mountain again.

81
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:12,913
I disagree.

82
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:15,802
Love is not a sprint,
it's a marathon--

83
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:19,986
a relentless pursuit that only ends
when she falls into your arms...

84
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:23,075
or hits you with
the pepper spray.

85
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:25,964
I'm done with Penny.

86
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:29,351
I'm going to be more realistic
and go after someone my own speed.

87
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,443
- Like who?
- I don't know...

88
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:32,938
Olivia Geiger.

89
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:36,325
The dietician at the cafeteria
with the limp and the lazy eye?

90
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:40,908
I don't think you have a shot there.

91
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:45,690
I have noticed that Leslie Winkle
recently started shaving her legs.

92
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,284
Now given that winter is coming,

93
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:50,074
one can only assume
she's signaling sexual availability.

94
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,963
I don't know.
You guys work in the same lab.

95
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,653
- So?
- There are pitfalls.

96
00:04:55,852 --> 00:04:57,147
Trust me, I know.

97
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:00,036
When it comes to
sexual harassment law,

98
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,627
I'm a bit of a self-taught expert.

99
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:07,409
If I were to ask Leslie Winkle out,

100
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,198
it would just be for dinner.
I'm not going to walk into the lab,

101
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:12,390
ask her to strip naked
and dance for me.

102
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,582
Oh, then you're probably okay.

103
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,460
- Hello, Leslie.
- Hi, Leonard.

104
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,253
I'd like to propose an experiment...

105
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,046
- Goggles, Leonard.
- Right.

106
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:28,131
I would like to propose an experiment.

107
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:29,227
Hang on.

108
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:31,518
I'm trying to see how long it
takes a 500-kilowatt

109
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:34,109
oxygen iodine laser to heat up
my Cup a' Noodles.

110
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,990
I've done it. About two seconds.
2.6 for minestrone.

111
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,459
Anyway, I was thinking more

112
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:50,746
of a bio-social exploration
with a neuro-chemical overlay.

113
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,532
Wait, are you asking me out?

114
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:58,517
I was going to characterize it
as the modification

115
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:00,709
of our
colleague-slash-friendship paradigm

116
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,602
with the addition
of a date-like component,

117
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:05,690
but we don't need to
quibble over terminology.

118
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:08,580
What sort of experiment?

119
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,369
There's a generally accepted
pattern in this area.

120
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:13,661
I would pick you up,
take you to a restaurant.

121
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,550
Then we would see a movie,
probably a romantic comedy

122
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:19,240
featuring the talents
of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.

123
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:22,029
Interesting.
And would you agree

124
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,620
that the primary way we would
evaluate either the success

125
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,114
or failure of the date would be

126
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:29,003
based on the biochemical reaction
during the good night kiss?

127
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:30,796
Heart rate,
pheromones, etc. Yes.

128
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,184
Why don't we just stipulate
that the date goes well

129
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:35,678
and move to the key variable?

130
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:37,671
- You mean kiss you now?
- Yes.

131
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:39,863
Can you define the
parameters of the kiss?

132
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:41,556
Close-mouthed but romantic.
Mint?

133
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:42,951
Thank you.

134
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:51,320
I count down from three?

135
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,511
No, I think it needs
to be spontaneous.

136
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:03,374
- What do you think?
- You proposed the experiment.

137
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:05,566
I think you should
present your findings first.

138
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,160
Fair enough.

139
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:10,050
On the plus side,
it was a good kiss.

140
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:12,441
Reasonable technique,
no extraneous spittle.

141
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,127
On the other hand, no arousal.

142
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:18,817
- None?
- None.

143
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:25,492
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

144
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:31,669
None at all?

145
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:38,344
Sheldon,
if you were a robot,

146
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:41,332
and I knew
and you didn't...

147
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:45,616
...would you want me to tell you?

148
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,406
That depends.

149
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,000
When

150
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:51,694
I learn that I'm a robot...

151
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,583
will I be able to handle it?

152
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:59,464
Maybe-- although the history
of science fiction is not on your side.

153
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,453
Okay,
let me ask you this--

154
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:04,844
when I learn that I'm a robot,

155
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:08,132
would I be bound
by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?

156
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:12,416
You might be bound
by them right now.

157
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:18,194
That's true.
Have you ever harmed a human being

158
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:20,585
or through inaction allowed
a human being to come to harm?

159
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:22,678
- Of course not.
- Have you ever harmed yourself

160
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,272
or allowed yourself to be harmed

161
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,862
except in cases where a human being
would have been endangered?

162
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:28,954
- Well, no.
- I smell robot.

163
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,135
Hey, what's going on?

164
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:36,426
Internet's been down
for half an hour.

165
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:40,810
Also, Sheldon may be a robot.

166
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,595
So how'd it go with Leslie?

167
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,780
Oh, we tried kissing,
but the Earth didn't move.

168
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:53,960
I mean, any more than the 383 miles
that it was going to move anyway.

169
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:58,344
Oh, I've seen that look before.

170
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:00,635
This is just going to be
two weeks of moping

171
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:02,229
and tedious emo songs

172
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:05,218
and calling me to come down
to pet stores to look at cats.

173
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:09,104
I don't know if I can take it.

174
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,694
You could power down.

175
00:09:14,683 --> 00:09:16,974
As usual, Wolowitz has the solution.

176
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,063
I happen to know a place

177
00:09:20,262 --> 00:09:23,649
where there are plenty of eligible women
and Leonard could have his pick.

178
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:35,505
Remember the Latin hips.

179
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:38,693
Shoulders stay still, and...
we sway.

180
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:45,468
One, two, three...

181
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:48,456
...five, six, seven.

182
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:51,943
I think Mrs. Tishman's
got her eye on you.

183
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:55,032
I've been there.
You're in for a treat.

184
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:13,363
Oh, good Lord.

185
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,816
God, that's a good song.

186
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:29,403
If you're compiling a mix CD
for a double suicide.

187
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:33,388
Oh, I hope
that scratching post is for you.

188
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:37,174
I know what you're thinking.
I've taken your asthma into account.

189
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:39,565
There's a feline geneticist
in San Diego

190
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,454
who's developed the cutest
little hypoallergenic calicos.

191
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:44,746
- Listen to me...
- I've been thinking about names.

192
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,937
I'm kind of torn between
Einstein, Newton

193
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:48,830
and Sergeant Fuzzy Boots.

194
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:51,919
Do you really think
you can satisfy your need

195
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,111
for a relationship with
a genetically altered cat?

196
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:56,203
Maybe.

197
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:58,295
If it's a cute, little, cuddly cat.

198
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,786
Oh, come on. Leonard...

199
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:05,070
This is obviously about Penny.

200
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:08,756
It doesn't matter.

201
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:11,745
The woman's not interested in me.
The woman rejected me.

202
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,136
Look,

203
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,825
I think that you have
as much of a chance

204
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:18,818
of having a sexual relationship
with Penny

205
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:20,910
as the Hubble Telescope
does of discovering

206
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,504
at the center of every black hole

207
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:25,393
is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.

208
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:29,578
Nevertheless,

209
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,865
I do feel obligated
to point out to you

210
00:11:33,463 --> 00:11:35,356
that she did not reject you.

211
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:37,448
You did not ask her out.

212
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:40,238
You're right.

213
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,928
I didn't ask her out.
I should ask her out.

214
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:44,920
No, no, that was not my point.

215
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:47,909
My point was don't buy a cat.

216
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:50,400
No, but you're right.

217
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:52,890
I should march over there
and ask her out.

218
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:55,879
Oh, goody, we're getting a cat.

219
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:06,739
Good afternoon, Penny.
So, hi... hey.

220
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,321
I was wondering if you
had plans for dinner.

221
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:12,816
You mean dinner tonight?

222
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,303
There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word "dinner."

223
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:17,897
Technically it refers

224
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:20,288
to the largest meal of the day
whenever it's consumed.

225
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,480
So to clarify here,
by dinner I mean supper.

226
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,572
- Supper?
- Or dinner.

227
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,557
I was thinking 6:30 if you can go.
Or a different time.

228
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:29,852
6:30's great.

229
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,247
Really?

230
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:35,630
- Great.
- I like hanging out with you guys.

231
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,025
Us guys?

232
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,815
Yeah, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj.
Who all's coming?

233
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,106
They...

234
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:44,796
might all be there.

235
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:48,980
Or a subset
of them might be there.

236
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,770
Algebraically speaking,
there are too many unknowns.

237
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,962
For example,
Sheldon had Quiznos for lunch.

238
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:56,552
Sometimes he finds that filling,
other times he doesn't.

239
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:59,242
It's no fault of Quiznos--
they have a varied menu.

240
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,327
Okay, whatever.
It sounds like fun.

241
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:05,020
Great.

242
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,113
- Did we say a time?
- 6:30.

243
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:08,906
- And that's still good?
- It's fine.

244
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:11,397
- 'Cause it's not carved in stone.
- No, 6:30's great.

245
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:13,289
I'll get my chisel.

246
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:15,979
Why?

247
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,459
To... carve the...
I'll see you at 6:30.

248
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:34,211
How do I look?

249
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,085
Could you be more specific?

250
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,971
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

251
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:50,450
No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.

252
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,734
- What time is your date?
- 6:30.

253
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,029
Perfect. That gives you

254
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:58,620
two hours and 15 minutes
for that dense molecular cloud

255
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,313
of Aramis to dissipate.

256
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:02,605
Is it too much?

257
00:14:02,804 --> 00:14:04,498
Not if you're a rugby team.

258
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,885
If it should ever come up,

259
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:09,878
you didn't join us
because you stuffed yourself

260
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:11,770
with a chicken carbonara sub
at Quiznos.

261
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:13,364
Why would I join you?

262
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,457
No reason.

263
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:20,637
You know what,
maybe this isn't such a good idea.

264
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:23,327
No, well, now there's
always the possibility

265
00:14:23,526 --> 00:14:25,619
that alcohol and poor judgment
on her part

266
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:28,109
might lead to a nice
romantic evening.

267
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:32,792
You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment--
it could go well.

268
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,282
There is the other
possibility,  that...

269
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,375
this date kicks off
a rather unpleasant 6 months

270
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:39,467
of the two of you passing
awkwardly in the hall,

271
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,057
until one of you breaks down and
moves to another zip code.

272
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,943
You could've stopped
at "it could go well."

273
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:48,732
If I could've, I would've.

274
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,123
I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.

275
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:54,610
There's no reason we couldn't go
and have a lovely dinner,

276
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:57,001
maybe take a walk afterwards,

277
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,392
talk about things we have in common.

278
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:02,481
You love pottery?
I love pottery!

279
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:04,373
There's a pause,

280
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,565
we both know what's happening.
I lean in, we kiss.

281
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:08,857
It's a little tentative at first,
but then I realize

282
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:11,148
she's kissing me back.
She's biting my lower lip!

283
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:13,141
She wants me!
This thing is going the distance!

284
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,731
We're going to have sex!
Oh, God, oh, my God!

285
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:19,816
Is the sex starting now?

286
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,804
I'm having a panic attack.

287
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,694
Well then... calm down.

288
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,184
If I could,
I wouldn't be having a panic...

289
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:30,077
That's why they call it a panic attack.

290
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:32,369
Sit down.

291
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,760
Yeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.

292
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,254
- Why?
- Just do it.

293
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:39,641
Now try to increase
your alpha wave activity.

294
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,730
- What?!
- It's a biofeedback technique.

295
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:44,922
It's relaxation through
brain wave manipulation.

296
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:47,512
I read a paper about it
in Journal of American Neuroscience.

297
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:50,600
It was a little sparsely sourced,
but I think the basic science is valid.

298
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,194
I probably have it here somewhere.

299
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,984
Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.

300
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:56,578
You need to call her and cancel.

301
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:57,774
- Me?
- Yes.

302
00:15:57,973 --> 00:16:00,364
- What should I tell her?
- I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.

303
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,950
Not an illness that will make her
want to take care of me,

304
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,341
but nothing so critical
that she'll feel uncomfortable

305
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,533
going out with me
if I want to try this again.

306
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,124
Got it.
So I'm assuming nothing venereal?

307
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:18,197
I'll just tell her
that you had a routine colonoscopy

308
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:19,691
and haven't quite bounced back.

309
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,979
- Give me the phone.
- I thought you wanted to cancel.

310
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,769
I can't, because if I don't show up
she'll still be expecting you.

311
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:28,259
Why would she be expecting me?

312
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,248
Stop asking me all these questions.

313
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:33,241
I need to take another shower.

314
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,421
So are the rest of the guys
meeting us here?

315
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:40,015
Oh, yeah... no.

316
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,698
It turns out that Raj
and Howard had to work, and Sheldon...

317
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,384
had a colonoscopy and he hasn't
quite bounced back yet.

318
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,269
My uncle just had a colonoscopy.

319
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:53,565
You're kidding.

320
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,055
Then that's something
we have in common.

321
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:58,147
How?

322
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:01,535
We both have people
in our lives who...

323
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,822
want to nip intestinal polyps
in the bud.

324
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,191
So what's new in
the world of physics?

325
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:15,483
Nothing.

326
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,272
Really? Nothing?

327
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,261
Well, with the exception
of string theory,

328
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,951
not much has happened
since the 1930s.

329
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,744
And you can't prove string theory.

330
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:27,139
At best you can say,

331
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:30,925
"Hey, look, my idea
has an internal logical consistency."

332
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:36,105
Well, I'm sure things will pick up.

333
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:42,183
What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?

334
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:44,972
Not much.

335
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:48,359
We do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.

336
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:50,850
Good.

337
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:52,643
Good.

338
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,625
What about your...

339
00:17:58,721 --> 00:17:59,916
hallway friend?

340
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,706
Doug?
Oh, yeah, I don't know.

341
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:04,997
I mean, you know,
he's nice and funny, but...

342
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:06,990
Can I get you started with some drinks?

343
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:10,477
- You were saying? But...
- I'd like a drink.

344
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:13,964
Just say the "but" thing about Doug
and then I'll get her back.

345
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:17,451
I don't know, it's just me.

346
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,842
I'm still getting over
this breakup with Kurt

347
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,532
and this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.

348
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:26,317
Don't get me started
on rebound sex.

349
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:29,505
It's just... it's my pattern.

350
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:31,896
I break up,
then I find some cute guy,

351
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:35,085
and then it's just 36
meaningless hours of...

352
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,878
you know.

353
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,265
I'm not sure that I do.

354
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:45,047
Is that one 36-hour experience,

355
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,538
or is that 36 hours
spread out over, say...

356
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:49,630
one glorious summer?

357
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:51,822
No, it's usually over a weekend,

358
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,512
and trust me, you do not feel
good after it.

359
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,903
Well, chafing, right?

360
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,593
Emotionally.

361
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,884
Of course, yeah,
emotional chafing.

362
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:11,149
Do you want to see something cool?

363
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:15,633
I can make this olive
go into this glass

364
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:17,227
without touching it.

365
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,717
- How?
- Physics.

366
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:27,588
Centrifugal force.

367
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:30,079
Actually, it's centripetal force,

368
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:32,669
which is an inward force
generated by the glass

369
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:34,363
acting on the olive...

370
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:36,754
Excuse me.

371
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:39,842
If you were riding
on the olive,

372
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:42,233
you'd be in a non-inertial
reference frame

373
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,628
and would...

374
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:47,214
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

375
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:50,502
Did you spill ketchup?

376
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:52,096
- No.
- I'm not okay.

377
00:19:57,177 --> 00:19:59,269
You sure you don't want to go
to the emergency room?

378
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:01,461
No, I'm okay.
It stopped bleeding.

379
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:05,048
I know, but you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

380
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:07,239
Yes.
But I get car sick, too, so...

381
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,424
Sorry about
your car, by the way.

382
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,711
It's fine.
You got most of it out the window.

383
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,401
The poor guy on the bike.

384
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,685
I had a nice time.

385
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:23,279
Yeah, me, too.

386
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:25,770
Well, um, good night.

387
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:27,663
Good night.

388
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:33,342
Was this supposed to be a date?

389
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:35,434
This?

390
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:37,626
No.

391
00:20:40,316 --> 00:20:42,308
Of course not.
This was just you and me

392
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,600
hanging out with a bunch of guys
who didn't show up

393
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:46,891
'cause of work and a colonoscopy.

394
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:50,179
Okay, I was just checking.

395
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:53,466
When I take a girl on a date--

396
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:54,762
and I do--

397
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:58,946
she knows she's been dated.

398
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:01,935
Capital D.

399
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,518
Boldface. Underlined.
Da...ted.

400
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:10,403
I think I might have
a little concussion.

401
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,993
I'm gonna go lie down for a while.
Good night.

402
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,473
So, how was your date?

403
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,166
Awesome!

404
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,841
Score 1 for liquor and poor jugement.
